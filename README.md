February 2022

IN THIS REPO:
-------------
- Check out the `Understanding Options Contracts.ipynb` File, which describes three `class` objects and my attempts at
-  an inheritance/inter-operational structure using the `yfinance` API; plenty of `@property.setters` and conditional logic.

- `functions.py` describes the culmination of my efforts in October and November to use the IEX CLOUD `json` API; 
    - parsing data from multiple endpoints; batch requests;
    - plotting trend reversals (`find_gold()`) and bollinger bands; etc.
    - `chunks` to split API batches


-- # TODO : implement into it's own package! Of course. I've left things as they are for now in order to close up work on my Capstone-Rework project.
